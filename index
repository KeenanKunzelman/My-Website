I am soon to be transferring into a Computer Science program at Suny Plattsburgh. I have been learning C#, Python, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery and basic networking principles over the past few years. In my free time outside of learning new development skills, I enjoy Skateboarding, Snowboarding, and working on cars with my father.</p>

    <p class="lead text-center">This is a short little Python script I wrote to solve the problem of driving 45 minutes to a cancelled class at my College. They have no form of notifying students of class cancellations other than putting them on their website and it is up to the student to check. This led me to write a script that would send me a textmessage every time I had a cancelled class.</p>

It is a mockup application for a buisness that is in the hudson valley. It showcases all the tools we learned over the semester such as GPS, Frame Navigation, use of the camera, and much more.</p>
